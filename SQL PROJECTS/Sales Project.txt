Sales Data Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project involves the exploration and analysis of a sales dataset to uncover insights and trends related to sales performance, customer demographics, product profitability, and geographic sales distribution. The analysis is done using SQL with a focus on data cleaning, transformation, and performing various data analyses for decision-making.

The project covers key business questions such as:

Sales trends across time (years, months, quarters, weeks)
Profitability analysis across products, categories, and geographies
Customer demographics analysis (age group, gender)
Product performance and seasonality trends
Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains the following key attributes:

Date: The date of the sales transaction.
Day, Month, Year: Breakdown of the date for time-based analysis.
Customer_Age: The age of the customer making the purchase.
Age_Group: Categorized age groups (e.g., Adults, Youth).
Customer_Gender: The gender of the customer (Male, Female).
Country, State: Geographic information on where the transaction occurred.
Product_Category, Sub_Category: The category and sub-category of the purchased product.
Product: The specific product being sold.
Order_Quantity: The quantity of the product purchased.
Unit_Cost, Unit_Price: The cost and selling price per unit of the product.
Profit, Cost, Revenue: Financial metrics related to each sale.
Data Cleaning
Before performing the analysis, the dataset was cleaned with the following steps:

Duplicate Removal: Duplicates were removed to ensure the integrity of the data.
Standardization: Columns like Customer_Gender and Age_Group were standardized for consistency.
Correcting Calculations: The Revenue and Profit columns were recalculated based on order quantities, unit prices, and costs.

Country-Level Analysis: Summarized sales and profit by country and state, identifying which regions contribute the most to total sales and profitability.
Profit Margins: Calculated profit margins across different countries and states to understand geographic profitability.
3. Product and Category Analysis
Top and Bottom Performing Products: Identified the top 10 best-selling products and least performing products in terms of revenue and profit.
Product Profitability: Measured profit margins for each product category and sub-category to understand which products were the most profitable.
Seasonal Product Trends: Analyzed product performance across different seasons and identified the peak months for each product category.
4. Customer Demographics Analysis
Age Group and Gender-Based Trends: Analyzed the total sales, profit, and average order quantity across customer age groups and genders.
Gender-Specific Products: Identified products that were predominantly bought by either male or female customers.
